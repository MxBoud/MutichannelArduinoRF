# MutichannelArduinoRF

This project is a demonstration of two way RF communication between a master unit and multiple slaves. 

In the example, there is two slaves. More slaves can be added by slightly modifying the master code, and adding other slaves with uniques ID. 

The code can also be modified to add more commands for the slaves to react at (right now, the only command is "STATUS").
